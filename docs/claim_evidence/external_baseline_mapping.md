# External Baseline Mapping

This note explains the distinction enforced by
`docs/claim_evidence/external_baseline_mapping.json`.

## Claim Protocol

The claim protocol is the exact measurement contract for the current UPS claim:
the `light-v1` PDEBench-shaped task set, train/validation/test split boundaries,
sample caps, 16-step decoded rollout horizon, `decoded_rollout_nrmse`, command,
promotion rule, held-out ledger, and artifact bundle.

A fair baseline on the claim protocol is valuable because it answers: if another
model is given the same data budget and judged by the same metric, does UPS win?
The committed `physical_fourier_light_test_strong_baseline` answers that for a
repo-local Fourier neural baseline.

## External-Paper Reproduction

An external-paper reproduction is stricter. It means running an outside paper's
official implementation, or a faithful implementation with declared architecture
and hyperparameters, and then mapping the result to this claim protocol. A
published table value is not enough when the split, sample budget, rollout
horizon, metric, or task bundle differs.

The highest-signal next reproduction path is FNO through PDEBench and/or
NeuralOperator because FNO is canonical, PDEBench names it as an official
baseline family, and the current repo already has PDEBench-shaped data plus a
local Fourier sanity baseline.

The executable adapter is
`scripts/run_external_neuraloperator_fno_baseline.py`. It keeps NeuralOperator as
an optional dependency: `--dry-run` validates and writes the contract without
loading data or requiring `neuralop`, while a live run imports
`neuralop.models.FNO`. A live `split=test` run fails closed unless
`--allow-held-out-test-eval` is set, so adapter debugging stays on validation
unless the held-out measurement is deliberate.

## Tradeoff

The local strong baseline is fast and already comparable to the current claim,
but it cannot support an external SOTA claim. An official FNO/PDEBench
reproduction is slower to wire up, but it is the shortest defensible bridge from
repo-local readiness to a public-baseline claim.
