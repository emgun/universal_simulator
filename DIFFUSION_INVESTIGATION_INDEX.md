## Key Findings Summary

### Finding 1: Loss Scale is Intentional

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---|
| Operator loss | 0.0002 | Predicts full signal, very accurate |
| Diffusion loss | 0.01 | Predicts tiny corrections, also very accurate |
| Ratio | 50x | Expected (residuals are 50x smaller) |

**Status**: NOT A BUG - This is correct behavior

---

### Finding 2: Golden Config Overfits

| Config | NRMSE | Issue | Solution |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Golden (current) | 0.0776 | Overfitting | Switch to Light-Diffusion |
| Light-Diffusion | 0.0651 | None | **USE THIS** |
| Improvement | 16.2% | Better generalization | Recommended |

**Evidence**: -0.394 correlation between train loss and eval NRMSE (when train↓, eval↑ = bad)

---

### Finding 3: 3-Layer MLP is Sufficient

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Convergence | ✅ Excellent | 99% loss reduction |
| Gradients | ✅ Healthy | ~7.5 max norm |
| Capacity | ✅ Sufficient | 12,592 parameters sufficient |
| Complexity | ✅ Optimal | 3 layers = sweet spot |

**Status**: Architecture is fit for purpose

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. Use Light-Diffusion config instead of Golden
2. Monitor for overfitting: correlation(diffusion_loss, eval_nrmse)

### Medium-Term (Next Sprint)
1. Implement stratified tau sampling (~20 lines code)
2. Add tau-dependent loss weighting
3. Investigate skip connections (if needed)

### Long-Term (Future Research)
1. Multi-scale residual learning
2. Condition on operator uncertainty
3. Adaptive tau distribution learning

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Is 0.01 diffusion loss bad?**  
A: No, it's expected and correct. Residuals are 50x smaller than full signal.

**Q: Should I use Golden or Light-Diffusion config?**  
A: Light-Diffusion. It's 16.2% better and prevents overfitting.

**Q: Is the 3-layer MLP sufficient?**  
A: Yes, for Burgers1D. For complex PDEs, consider skip connections.

**Q: Should I change tau sampling?**  
A: Only if inference heavily uses extreme tau values (near 0 or 1).

**Q: What's the real issue?**  
A: Golden config overfits. Light-Diffusion fixes it.
