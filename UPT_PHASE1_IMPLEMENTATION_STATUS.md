# UPT Phase 1 Implementation Status

## Overview

Phase 1 of UPT Inverse Losses implementation is **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**. The core infrastructure for inverse losses is fully implemented and ready for testing, but data loading integration is deferred to Phase 1.5.

## Completed Components ‚úÖ

### 1. Loss Functions (`src/ups/training/losses.py`)
- ‚úÖ Refactored `inverse_encoding_loss()` with correct UPT semantics
  - Now implements: fields ‚Üí encode ‚Üí decode ‚Üí MSE in physical space
  - Ensures latent representations are decodable
- ‚úÖ Refactored `inverse_decoding_loss()` with correct UPT semantics
  - Now implements: latent ‚Üí decode ‚Üí re-encode ‚Üí MSE in latent space
  - Ensures decoder outputs are re-encodable
- ‚úÖ Added `compute_operator_loss_bundle()` function
  - Unified loss computation for operator training
  - Supports optional inverse losses, rollout, spectral losses
  - Returns `LossBundle` with total loss and individual components

### 2. Training Loop (`scripts/train.py`)
- ‚úÖ Added encoder/decoder instantiation when inverse losses enabled
  - Checks `lambda_inv_enc` and `lambda_inv_dec` in config
  - Creates GridEncoder and AnyPointDecoder matching main architecture
  - Sets to eval mode (not trained during operator stage)
- ‚úÖ Modified `train_operator()` loop to use loss bundle
  - Extracts physical fields/coords from batch if available
  - Builds loss weights dict from config
  - Calls `compute_operator_loss_bundle()` with all inputs
  - Logs individual loss components to WandB every 10 batches
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of missing physical fields
  - If batch doesn't contain `input_fields`, `coords`, `meta`
  - Inverse losses are simply skipped (no errors)

### 3. Configuration Files
- ‚úÖ Created `configs/test_upt_losses_1epoch.yaml`
  - Fast 1-epoch test config for validation
  - lambda_inv_enc: 0.5, lambda_inv_dec: 0.5
  - Disables compile, wandb for fast local testing
- ‚úÖ Created `configs/train_burgers_upt_losses.yaml`
  - Full 25-epoch production config
  - Based on golden config with inverse losses added
  - Re-enables consistency distillation (8 epochs)
  - Expected: 10-20% NRMSE improvement

## Deferred to Phase 1.5 ‚è∏Ô∏è

### Data Loading (`src/ups/data/latent_pairs.py`)

**Why deferred:**
- Requires modifying `LatentPair` dataclass structure
- Requires updating `unpack_batch()` function
- Requires changes to latent cache format
- Current training loop already handles missing fields gracefully

**Recommended approach for Phase 1.5:**
1. Extend `LatentPair` dataclass to optionally include:
   - `input_fields: Optional[Dict[str, Tensor]]`
   - `coords: Optional[Tensor]`
   - `meta: Optional[Dict]`
2. Modify `GridLatentPairDataset.__getitem__()` to:
   - Check config flag `use_inverse_losses`
   - If enabled, include physical fields alongside latents
   - Compute on subset (every Nth batch) to reduce overhead
3. Update `unpack_batch()` to handle extended format
4. Test with both old and new data formats (backward compatibility)

**Estimated effort:** 2-4 hours

## Testing Status üß™

### Unit Tests
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Deferred**: `tests/unit/test_losses.py`
  - Can add basic tests for new loss function signatures
  - Full integration tests require data loading changes

### Integration Testing
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Can test refactored code without inverse losses**
  - Current implementation will run normally
  - Inverse losses will be skipped (lambda weights have no effect)
  - Validates refactored code doesn't break existing training

## Current Behavior

**With current implementation:**
```yaml
# Config has inverse loss weights set
training:
  lambda_inv_enc: 0.5
  lambda_inv_dec: 0.5
  use_inverse_losses: true
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Encoder and decoder are instantiated
2. ‚úÖ Training loop checks for physical fields in batch
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Batch doesn't contain physical fields (not yet implemented)
4. ‚úÖ Inverse losses are gracefully skipped
5. ‚úÖ Training proceeds normally with only forward loss

**Result:** Training works correctly, but inverse losses are not actually computed yet.

## Next Steps for Phase 1.5

### Priority 1: Enable Inverse Losses
1. Implement data loading changes (see deferred section above)
2. Add unit tests for inverse loss functions
3. Run 1-epoch test to validate inverse losses compute correctly
4. Check WandB logs show `L_inv_enc` and `L_inv_dec` decreasing

### Priority 2: Validation
5. Run full 25-epoch training with inverse losses
6. Compare NRMSE vs baseline (golden config)
7. Verify 10-20% improvement as expected
8. Check encoder/decoder invertibility (reconstruction error < 1e-3)

### Priority 3: Documentation
9. Update plan markdown with completed checkboxes
10. Document findings in experiment notes
11. Create comparison report vs baseline

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/ups/training/losses.py` - Loss functions refactored
- `scripts/train.py` - Training loop updated

### Configuration
- `configs/test_upt_losses_1epoch.yaml` - Test config created
- `configs/train_burgers_upt_losses.yaml` - Production config created

### Documentation
- `UPT_PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - This file

## References

- **Plan**: `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-23-upt-inverse-losses-implementation.md`
- **Analysis**: `UPT_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` (gap analysis)
- **Baseline**: `configs/train_burgers_golden.yaml` (NRMSE: 0.078)

## Summary

Phase 1 core infrastructure is **COMPLETE and READY FOR TESTING**. The refactored code can be tested immediately to verify it doesn't break existing training. Data loading changes for actual inverse loss computation are a well-scoped follow-up task (Phase 1.5) estimated at 2-4 hours of focused work.

**Recommendation:** Merge current implementation as Phase 1 (infrastructure), then tackle data loading as Phase 1.5 (activation).
