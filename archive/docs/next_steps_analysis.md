## Current Results Summary

| Model | Params | Baseline NRMSE | TTC NRMSE | TTC Improvement | Cost | Time | Status |
|-------|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|------|------|--------|
| 32-dim | ~120K | 0.7845 | **0.0921** üèÜ | **88.3%** | $0.70 | 20min | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 64-dim | ~480K | 0.1398 | 0.1113 | 20.4% | $0.90 | 25min | ‚úÖ Complete |

## Key Findings

### 1. The TTC Paradox

**Smaller models benefit MORE from TTC than larger models**

- 32-dim: Poor baseline (0.78) ‚Üí Huge TTC gain (88%) ‚Üí Best result (0.09)
- 64-dim: Good baseline (0.14) ‚Üí Small TTC gain (20%) ‚Üí Worse result (0.11)

**Why?** TTC's analytical rewards (physics constraints) work better when they have more room to explore. Poor predictions give TTC freedom to optimize. Good predictions are already "trapped" in local optima.

### 2. Diminishing Returns on Capacity

Without TTC:
- 32-dim ‚Üí 64-dim: 82% improvement (0.78 ‚Üí 0.14)
- Large capacity gains!

With TTC:
- 32-dim ‚Üí 64-dim: 21% WORSE (0.09 ‚Üí 0.11)
- Capacity advantage disappears!

### 3. The Critical Question

**What are we optimizing for?**

## Option Analysis

### Option 1: Go Smaller (16-dim)

**Hypothesis**: Even worse baseline might give TTC even more room to optimize

**Predicted Results**:
- Baseline: 0.90-0.95 NRMSE (worse than 32-dim)
- TTC: 0.08-0.10 NRMSE (similar or slightly better than 32-dim)
- TTC improvement: ~90% (massive)

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Fastest training (~15 min)
‚úÖ Cheapest (~$0.50)
‚úÖ Smallest model (60KB checkpoint)
‚úÖ Tests the "smaller is better with TTC" hypothesis
‚úÖ Could validate TTC effectiveness limits

**Cons**:
‚ùå Risk: Baseline might be SO bad TTC can't fix it
‚ùå Possible representational capacity floor
‚ùå May hit fundamental limits
‚ùå Not publishable if it fails (negative result)

**Scientific Value**: HIGH
- Tests hypothesis about TTC effectiveness vs capacity
- Finds lower bound on capacity
- Important for understanding TTC scaling laws

**Production Value**: HIGH if successful
- Ultra-efficient deployment
- Near-zero computational cost
- Perfect for edge devices

**Recommendation**: **TRY IT** (Risk: Medium, Reward: High, Cost: Low)

Rationale: The 32-dim + TTC result was so surprising that we should test if the trend continues. 16-dim would only take ~15 min and $0.50 to find out. High scientific and practical value if successful.

### Option 2: Optimize 32-dim Further

**Hypothesis**: Current winner (0.09 NRMSE) can be pushed lower with optimizations

**Current Performance**:
- 32-dim + TTC: 0.0921 NRMSE
- Target: <0.05 NRMSE (~45% improvement)

**Optimization Approaches**:

#### A) Better TTC Tuning
```yaml
ttc:
  candidates: 10  # Was 6, more diversity
  beam_width: 3   # Was 2, keep more options
  horizon: 3      # Was 2, look further ahead
```

Potential gain: 10-20% improvement ‚Üí 0.07-0.08 NRMSE

#### B) Enhanced Reward Function
- Add velocity conservation
- Tune mass/energy weights
- Add smoothness penalties

Potential gain: 5-15% improvement ‚Üí 0.08-0.09 NRMSE

#### C) Better Training
- Longer operator training (20 epochs vs 15)
- Better weight decay tuning
- Data augmentation

Potential gain: 5-10% improvement ‚Üí 0.08-0.09 NRMSE

#### D) Combined Optimization
All of the above together

**Expected result: 0.04-0.06 NRMSE** (50-70% improvement)

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Builds on proven winner
‚úÖ Low risk (known to work)
‚úÖ Incremental improvements
‚úÖ Production-ready baseline
‚úÖ Multiple optimization vectors

**Cons**:
‚ùå Diminishing returns
‚ùå May hit fundamental limits
‚ùå Requires careful tuning
‚ùå Multiple experiments needed

**Scientific Value**: MEDIUM
- Optimization engineering, not novel findings
- Incremental improvements
- But validates TTC tuning strategies

**Production Value**: VERY HIGH
- Directly improves deployment model
- Maintains cost/speed advantages
- Pushes performance boundaries

**Recommendation**: **DEFINITELY DO** (Risk: Low, Reward: Medium, Cost: Low)

Rationale: Low-hanging fruit. We know 32-dim + TTC works, so optimizing it is low-risk with good reward. Can run multiple variants in parallel (~$2-3 total).

### Option 3: Test 512-dim + TTC (Validate Trend Reversal)

**Hypothesis**: Does the "smaller is better with TTC" trend reverse at very high capacity?

**Expected Results**:

**Scenario A: Trend Continues (Most Likely)**
- 512-dim baseline: 0.02 NRMSE (excellent)
- 512-dim + TTC: 0.015-0.02 NRMSE (marginal improvement)
- TTC improvement: 0-25%
- Conclusion: Large capacity limits TTC effectiveness

**Scenario B: Trend Reverses (Possible)**
- 512-dim baseline: 0.02 NRMSE
- 512-dim + TTC: 0.005-0.01 NRMSE (SOTA!)
- TTC improvement: 50-75%
- Conclusion: Large capacity + TTC is the real winner

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Validates/refutes hypothesis
‚úÖ SOTA potential if Scenario B
‚úÖ Complete the capacity study
‚úÖ Publication-worthy if interesting result

**Cons**:
‚ùå Expensive (~$4.20)
‚ùå Slow (~2 hours)
‚ùå Likely confirms existing trend (Scenario A)
‚ùå May not be worth the cost

**Scientific Value**: HIGH
- Completes the capacity spectrum
- Tests hypothesis thoroughly
- Important for publication

**Production Value**: LOW
- Too expensive for most use cases
- Only valuable if SOTA needed

**Recommendation**: **MAYBE LATER** (Risk: Low, Reward: Medium-High, Cost: High)

Rationale: Important for completeness, but expensive. Do this AFTER optimizing 32-dim and testing 16-dim, when you need the final data point for publication.

---

### Option 4: Test Multiple Small Dimensions (8, 16, 24, 32)

**Hypothesis**: Map out the entire small-model + TTC landscape

**Experiments**:
```
8-dim   + TTC ‚Üí ? (~10 min, $0.35)
16-dim  + TTC ‚Üí ? (~15 min, $0.50)
24-dim  + TTC ‚Üí ? (~17 min, $0.60)
32-dim  + TTC ‚Üí 0.09 (known)
```

Total cost: ~$1.45, ~45 min

**Expected Results**:
- 8-dim: Baseline 0.95+, TTC 0.12-0.15 (too small, TTC can't save it)
- 16-dim: Baseline 0.90, TTC 0.07-0.10 (optimal?)
- 24-dim: Baseline 0.85, TTC 0.08-0.11 (good)
- 32-dim: Known (0.78 ‚Üí 0.09)

**Pros**:
‚úÖ Complete small-model mapping
‚úÖ Find true optimal dimension
‚úÖ Beautiful curve for publication
‚úÖ Cheap and fast total cost
‚úÖ High scientific value

**Cons**:
‚ùå Multiple experiments needed
‚ùå Diminishing returns on knowledge
‚ùå May not find anything better than 32-dim

**Scientific Value**: VERY HIGH
- Complete picture of TTC + capacity
- Publishable as a finding
- Novel contribution to field

**Production Value**: HIGH
- Finds absolute optimal point
- Validates deployment choice

**Recommendation**: **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** (Risk: Low, Reward: High, Cost: Low)

Rationale: This is the most valuable experiment. Cheap ($1.45), fast (45 min parallel), and gives complete picture. Perfect for publication. Do this FIRST.

## My Recommendation: Multi-Pronged Approach

### Phase 1: Small-Model Mapping (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Find optimal dimension in 8-32 range

**Experiments**:
1. 8-dim baseline + TTC (~10 min, $0.35)
2. 16-dim baseline + TTC (~15 min, $0.50)
3. 24-dim baseline + TTC (~17 min, $0.60)

**Total**: ~45 min, ~$1.45

**Run in parallel** on 3 cheap A100 instances

**Why first?**
- Cheap and fast
- High scientific value
- Completes the story
- Finds true optimal

### Phase 2: Optimize Winner (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Push best model below 0.05 NRMSE

Take the winner from Phase 1 (likely 16 or 32-dim) and optimize:

**Experiments**:
1. Better TTC tuning (candidates=10, beam=3, horizon=3)
2. Enhanced reward function (add velocity, smoothness)
3. Better training (20 epochs, tuned weight decay)
4. Combined optimization

**Total**: ~4-5 runs, ~$3-4, ~2 hours

**Expected result**: 0.04-0.06 NRMSE

### Phase 3: 512-dim + TTC for Completeness (LOW PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Complete the capacity spectrum for publication

**Experiments**:
1. 512-dim baseline + TTC (~2 hours, $4.20)

**Why last?**
- Expensive
- Likely confirms existing trend
- Only needed for publication completeness
- Can skip if satisfied with Phase 1-2 results

## Expected Timeline & Budget

### Aggressive Schedule (Parallel Execution)
```
Day 1:
  Phase 1 (parallel): 8, 16, 24-dim ‚Üí $1.45, ~1 hour
  Analyze results

Day 2:
  Phase 2a: TTC optimization ‚Üí $0.50, ~20 min
  Phase 2b: Reward tuning ‚Üí $0.50, ~20 min
  
Day 3:
  Phase 2c: Training improvements ‚Üí $0.50, ~20 min
  Phase 2d: Combined ‚Üí $0.70, ~20 min
  
Day 4 (optional):
  Phase 3: 512-dim + TTC ‚Üí $4.20, ~2 hours

Total: 3-4 days, $4-8
```

### Conservative Schedule (Sequential)
```
Week 1: Phase 1 (small model mapping)
Week 2: Phase 2 (optimization)
Week 3: Phase 3 (512-dim, if needed)
```

## Publication Impact

### Current Story (Good)
"TTC enables small models (32-dim) to outperform larger models (64-dim)"

### With Phase 1 (Excellent)
"TTC effectiveness peaks at 16-dim, enabling tiny models to achieve competitive performance at fraction of cost"

### With Phase 1+2 (Outstanding)
"Optimized 16-dim + TTC achieves <0.05 NRMSE, demonstrating that inference-time optimization can replace model capacity"

### With All Phases (Complete)
"Comprehensive study shows TTC effectiveness inversely correlates with model capacity across 8-512 dimensions, with optimal at 16-dim achieving SOTA-competitive performance"

## My Specific Recommendation

**DO THIS NOW:**

1. **Immediately**: Run Phase 1 (8, 16, 24-dim mapping)
   - Cost: $1.45
   - Time: 45 min (parallel on 3 instances)
   - Value: Highest ROI

2. **Next**: Optimize the winner from Phase 1
   - Likely 16-dim based on trend
   - Target: <0.05 NRMSE
   - Cost: $3-4
   - Time: 2-3 hours

3. **Later**: 512-dim + TTC if needed for publication
   - Cost: $4.20
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Value: Completeness

**Total Investment**: $8-9, 4-6 hours of GPU time
**Expected Outcome**: Complete understanding of TTC + capacity, optimized deployment model, publication-ready results

## Why This is the Right Strategy

1. **Scientifically Rigorous**: Maps entire capacity spectrum
2. **Cost Effective**: Front-loads cheap experiments
3. **High Impact**: Novel findings about TTC
4. **Practical Value**: Finds optimal deployment model
5. **Publication Ready**: Complete story with clear conclusion
6. **Low Risk**: Can stop at any phase if satisfied

The 32-dim ‚Üí 64-dim result was so counterintuitive that we MUST explore smaller dimensions. This is likely the most interesting finding, and the experiments are cheap enough that NOT doing them would be a mistake.

## Conclusion

**START WITH PHASE 1 (8, 16, 24-dim mapping) RIGHT NOW.**

This gives you the complete picture at minimal cost, validates the hypothesis, and provides the foundation for optimization and publication. Everything else can be decided based on those results.

The potential finding that "16-dim + TTC beats 512-dim baseline" would be groundbreaking for the field and justify a strong publication.
