# Archive Directory

This directory contains deprecated files that have been superseded by newer implementations or are no longer part of the production workflow.

## Structure

- `configs/` - Old training and evaluation configurations
- `scripts/` - Deprecated scripts and utilities
- `docs/` - Historical documentation and analyses

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding past experiments
- Recovering old configurations if needed
- Audit trail of development decisions

## Migration Guide

See `/DEPRECATED.md` in the project root for details on:
- What replaced each deprecated file
- How to migrate to new approaches
- When to use archived vs production files
