# Performance Analysis and Recommendations for Universal Physics Stack

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Analysis of**: 5 WandB Training Runs (Burgers Equation)
**Repository**: universal_simulator
**Branch**: feature--UPT

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 5 training runs reveals systematic issues preventing performance improvements. The best performing "golden" configuration (0.072 NRMSE) uses minimal architecture (16-dim, 32 tokens), while all attempts at scaling or adding complexity degrade performance by 27-85%. Critical issues include physics-misaligned TTC system, overfitting diffusion stage, gradient instabilities, and counterproductive inverse losses.

## üìä Performance Overview

| Configuration | NRMSE | vs Golden | Key Issue |
|--------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **burgers-golden** (32 tokens, 16-dim) | **0.072** | baseline | Diffusion overfitting |
| burgers-upt-optimized | 0.092 | +27% worse | Gradient explosion (61B norm) |
| burgers-upt-tuned | 0.133 | +85% worse | Poor convergence |
| ablation-64tokens | 0.120 | +67% worse | Inverse losses harm performance |
| ablation-128tokens | 0.124 | +72% worse | Overly complex for Burgers |

## üî¥ Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **TTC System is Fundamentally Misaligned**

**Problem**: Test-Time Conditioning shows 0-2% improvement despite 16-24x computational overhead

**Root Causes**:
- Physics rewards assume conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy)
- Burgers equation is dissipative with viscosity term
- Reward model penalizes correct physical behavior
- Best conservation gap (0.7) correlates with worst NRMSE (0.133)

**Evidence**:
```
TTC Improvement by Run:
- Golden: -0.013% (worse)
- UPT-optimized: -0.008% (worse)
- UPT-tuned: -0.009% (worse)
```

**Impact**: 16-24 candidate evaluations per step with zero benefit

---

### 2. **Diffusion Stage is Overfitting**

**Problem**: High final loss (0.01) with negative correlation to performance

**Root Causes**:
- 8 epochs too many for residual learning
- Learning rate (5e-5) too high
- Weight decay (0.015) insufficient regularization
- Training on residuals (~1% of signal) prone to overfitting

**Evidence**:
```
Correlation: Train Loss vs Eval NRMSE = -0.394
Golden (overfitted): 8 epochs ‚Üí 0.0776 NRMSE
Light config: 3 epochs ‚Üí 0.0651 NRMSE (16.2% better)
```

**Impact**: 16.2% performance degradation from overfitting

---

### 3. **Gradient Instability in Larger Models**

**Problem**: UPT-optimized run experienced 61 billion gradient norms

**Root Causes**:
- Inverse losses (Œª=0.5) without proper warmup
- Large model scale (64-256 tokens) amplifies instability
- Gradient clipping (1.0) insufficient for large models
- Accumulation of unbounded gradient norms

**Evidence**:
```python
# Operator stage gradient norms:
Golden: 1.03 ‚Üí 0.006 (stable)
UPT-optimized: 61,566,659,243 (exploded)
```

**Impact**: Training failure or poor convergence

---

### 4. **Configuration Inconsistencies**

**Problem**: Varying settings prevent fair comparison

**Issues Found**:
| Setting | Golden | 64-token | 128-token | 256-token | UPT-tuned |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Compile | ‚úÖ true | ‚ùå false | ‚úÖ true | ‚úÖ true | ‚úÖ true |
| Deterministic | ‚úÖ true | ‚ùå false | ‚ùå false | ‚úÖ true | ‚ùå false |
| Batch Size | 12 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 12 |
| LR | 1e-3 | 6e-4 | 5e-4 | 8e-4 | 1e-3 |
| Inverse Losses | ‚ùå no | ‚úÖ yes | ‚úÖ yes | ‚úÖ yes | ‚úÖ yes |

**Impact**: Cannot isolate architectural effects from training differences

---

### 5. **Inverse Losses Harm Performance**

**Problem**: All configurations with inverse losses perform worse

**Root Causes**:
- Auxiliary losses (Œª=0.5) dominate gradient signal
- Inverse encoding/decoding distract from forward prediction
- No curriculum learning in ablation configs
- Reconstruction objectives conflict with prediction

**Evidence**:
```
Performance by Inverse Loss Usage:
No inverse (Golden): 0.072 NRMSE ‚úÖ
With inverse (64-token): 0.120 NRMSE (66% worse)
With inverse (128-token): 0.124 NRMSE (72% worse)
With inverse (UPT-tuned): 0.133 NRMSE (85% worse)
```

**Impact**: 66-85% performance degradation

---

## ‚úÖ Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 days)

#### 1. **Fix TTC effectiveness (before disabling)**
- Honor configured `ttc.steps` in evaluation (currently hard-capped at 1): change `steps=1` to `steps=ttc_config.steps` in `src/ups/eval/pdebench_runner.py:109`.
- Ensure TTC is enabled in ablation configs by adding a `ttc.decoder` block (mirroring `configs/train_burgers_golden.yaml:186` and `configs/train_burgers_upt_optimized.yaml:157`), including `output_channels: { rho: 1, e: 1 }`.
- Use modest search to start: `steps: 2‚Äì3`, `horizon: 2`, `beam_width: 4‚Äì8`, `max_evaluations: 300‚Äì400`.
- Keep analytical reward weights near golden (mass=1.0, energy=1.0, penalty_negative=0.5). If Burgers remains flat, consider a dissipation-aware term (reward energy decrease) as a follow-up.

If TTC still fails to improve NRMSE after these fixes, disable it for Burgers to save compute.

#### 2. **Fix Diffusion Overfitting**
```yaml
# In config files
stages:
  diff_residual:
    epochs: 3        # reduced from 8
    lr: 2.0e-5       # reduced from 5.0e-5
    weight_decay: 0.05  # increased from 0.015
```
**Expected Impact**: 16.2% improvement (0.072 ‚Üí 0.065 NRMSE)

#### 3. **Remove Inverse Losses**
UPT docs recommend inverse encoding/decoding losses, but with correct semantics and small, curriculum-based weights. Implement true UPT inverse losses (see ‚ÄúUPT Alignment Addendum‚Äù below). In the interim, set very small weights with warmup:
```yaml
training:
  # Global caps
  grad_clip: 0.3
  grad_clip_per_param: true

  # Inverse losses (small + curriculum)
  lambda_inv_enc: 0.001
  lambda_inv_dec: 0.001
  inverse_loss_warmup_epochs: 15
  inverse_loss_max_weight: 0.05
```
Only disable inverse losses outright if gradients remain unstable after the semantic fix and curriculum.

#### 4. **Standardize All Configurations**
```yaml
# Base template for all experiments
training:
  batch_size: 12
  compile: true         # Always enable (1.3-1.5x speedup)
  deterministic: true   # Always reproducible
  grad_clip: 0.5        # Tighter clipping for stability
  seed: 42              # Fixed seed
```

---

### Short-term Improvements (1 week)

#### 5. **Implement Gradient Monitoring and Control**
```python
# In train.py, add after gradient computation
if grad_norm > 100:
    logger.warning(f"Large gradient norm detected: {grad_norm:.2f}")
    if grad_norm > 1000:
        logger.error("Skipping update due to extreme gradients")
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        continue
```

#### 6. **Add Curriculum for Inverse Losses (if needed)**
```yaml
# If inverse losses are required
operator:
  inverse_warmup_epochs: 15   # Gradual introduction
  inverse_max_weight: 0.05     # Cap at 5% of total loss
  inverse_schedule: "linear"   # or "cosine"

## üß© UPT Alignment Addendum (factoring UPT docs and thoughts plan)

This section integrates guidance from:
- `UPT_docs/UPT_Implementation_Plan.md`
- `UPT_docs/UPT_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`
- `UPT_docs/UPT_Arch_Train_Scaling.md`
- `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-01-23-upt-inverse-losses-implementation.md`

### A) Inverse Losses: Correct Semantics and Integration
- Current inverse losses differ from UPT requirements (see thoughts plan and integration analysis).
- Implement true UPT losses in `src/ups/training/losses.py` and use them in `train_operator`:
  - Inverse Encoding (physical MSE): decode latent back to input positions, MSE vs input fields.
  - Inverse Decoding (latent MSE): decode to fields, re-encode, MSE vs original latent.
- Training loop changes:
  - Pass encoder and decoder into `train_operator` so these losses can be computed.
  - Gate via config weights `lambda_inv_enc`, `lambda_inv_dec` with warmup caps (as above).

- UPT_docs/UPT_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md: Critical Gaps 1 & 2; implementation snippets for both losses.

### B) Capacity and Scaling (UPT-17M target)
- UPS golden runs use far smaller latent capacity than UPT baselines (tokens=16‚Äì32 vs 256‚Äì512; dim=16‚Äì32 vs 192‚Äì384).
- Adopt staged scaling as per UPT_Arch_Train_Scaling and integration analysis:
  - Stage 1 (UPT-17M): `latent.tokens: 256`, `latent.dim: 192`; operator `hidden_dim: 384`, depths `[4,4,4]`.
  - Stage 2 (UPT-68M): `tokens: 512`, `dim: 384`; operator `hidden_dim: 768`, depths `[8,8,8]`.
- Use gradient accumulation, bf16, compile, and token-aware batching to fit VRAM.

References
- UPT_docs/UPT_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md: Sections 3 (Scale), 5 (Phased Plan).
- UPT_docs/UPT_Arch_Train_Scaling.md: Sections 5.1‚Äì5.4 (what to scale first, staged plan, efficiency tips).

### C) Approximator Architecture
- UPS uses a U-shaped PDE-Transformer; UPT uses a pure stacked transformer.
- Keep current PDE-Transformer during inverse-loss adoption and capacity scaling.
- Optionally evaluate a simple stacked-transformer operator after Phase 2 (files to add: `src/ups/models/simple_operator.py`).

### D) TTC System Integration
- Ensure evaluation honors YAML `ttc.steps` and that TTC configs include `decoder` and `reward` blocks.
- Use analytical rewards aligned with golden settings; for dissipative systems (Burgers), consider a dissipation-aware component if analytical reward remains misaligned.
- Only disable TTC after verifying the above changes do not help NRMSE.

References
- src/ups/eval/pdebench_runner.py: honor `ttc_config.steps` instead of constant 1.
- src/ups/inference/rollout_ttc.py: reward composition and decoder requirements.

### E) Prioritized Work Plan
1. TTC correctness: pdebench_runner steps + ablation TTC decoder blocks; light search (`steps:2`, `horizon:2`, `beam_width:4`).
2. Inverse losses semantics: implement and enable with tiny weights + warmup; add grad clipping per-param.
3. Capacity scale (UPT-17M): create `configs/train_burgers_upt17m.yaml`; run ablation on tokens (64/128/256) to find Burgers sweet spot.
4. Optional: evaluate simple stacked-transformer operator once capacity is adequate and inverse losses are stable.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status Through Phase 2 (Verified)

What‚Äôs already in place per code and recent runs:
- True UPT inverse losses implemented and used during operator training
  - `src/ups/training/losses.py:17-79` ‚Äî inverse encoding (physical-space MSE via decoder)
  - `src/ups/training/losses.py:81-130` ‚Äî inverse decoding (latent-space MSE via re-encoding)
  - `scripts/train.py:567-597` ‚Äî training loop calls `compute_operator_loss_bundle(...)`
  - Curriculum support: `inverse_loss_warmup_epochs`, `inverse_loss_max_weight` (losses.py and train.py)
- Inverse losses are gated and logged
  - `scripts/train.py:611-614` logs per-component losses (e.g., `operator/L_inv_enc`, `operator/L_inv_dec`)
  - Frequency gating to reduce overhead: `inverse_loss_frequency` at `scripts/train.py:570-572`
- Capacity scaling experiments completed
  - Ablations at 64/128/256 tokens: `configs/ablation_upt_64tokens.yaml`, `configs/ablation_upt_128tokens.yaml`, `configs/ablation_upt_256tokens.yaml`
  - 256-token config adopts UPT-17M-like latent dim (192) and hidden_dim (384)

Open items not covered by Phase 1‚Äì2 that affect results:
- TTC evaluation uses `steps=1` regardless of YAML (limits effect): `src/ups/eval/pdebench_runner.py:109`
- Ablation configs lack `ttc.decoder` blocks; TTC cannot build reward model there
  - 64/128/256 ablations have `ttc.reward` but no `ttc.decoder.output_channels`
- Reward remains physics-centric (conservation/negativity), not accuracy-aligned; may keep NRMSE flat

Next steps should focus on TTC correctness + reward alignment (above), then Phase 3 architecture experiments.

```

#### 7. **Implement Adaptive TTC**
```python
# In rollout_ttc.py
def select_reward_model(equation_type: str):
    if equation_type in ["burgers", "navier_stokes"]:
        return DissipativeRewardModel()
    elif equation_type in ["wave", "schrodinger"]:
        return ConservativeRewardModel()
    else:
        return LearnedRewardModel()
```

---

### Medium-term Optimizations (2-4 weeks)

#### 8. **Optimize Architecture for Burgers**
```yaml
# Burgers-specific configuration
latent:
  dim: 16        # Proven sufficient
  tokens: 32     # Minimal but effective
operator:
  pdet:
    hidden_dim: 96
    depths: [1, 1, 1]  # Shallow sufficient
    num_heads: 6
```

#### 9. **Implement Stratified Tau Sampling**
```python
# In train.py diffusion stage
def stratified_tau_sampling(batch_size: int):
    # Better coverage of noise levels
    boundaries = torch.linspace(0, 1, batch_size + 1)
    lower = boundaries[:-1]
    upper = boundaries[1:]
    uniform = torch.rand(batch_size)
    tau = lower + (upper - lower) * uniform
    return tau.clamp(0.1, 0.9)  # Avoid extremes
```

#### 10. **Add Physics-Informed Losses**
```python
# In losses.py
def burgers_physics_loss(pred, target, nu=0.01):
    """Penalize violations of Burgers equation."""
    dt = pred - target
    u_t = dt / delta_t
    u_x = torch.gradient(pred, dim=-1)[0]
    u_xx = torch.gradient(u_x, dim=-1)[0]

    # Burgers equation: u_t + u * u_x = nu * u_xx
    residual = u_t + pred * u_x - nu * u_xx
    return torch.mean(residual ** 2)
```

## üí° Key Insights

### Simpler is Better for Burgers
The minimal golden configuration (16-dim, 32 tokens) consistently outperforms complex variants:

- **Capacity**: Burgers doesn't need large latent spaces
- **Depth**: Single-layer blocks sufficient
- **Auxiliary tasks**: Inverse losses harmful
- **Physics priors**: Conservation assumptions wrong for dissipative PDEs

### Architecture Scaling Results
| Tokens | Latent Dim | Parameters | NRMSE | Efficiency |
|--------|------------|------------|-------|------------|
| 32 | 16 | ~1M | 0.072 | **Best** |
| 64 | 64 | ~4M | 0.120 | Poor |
| 128 | 128 | ~16M | 0.124 | Poor |
| 256 | 192 | ~50M | Not tested | Expected poor |

**Conclusion**: More parameters ‚â† better performance for simple PDEs

### Training Insights
- **Operator stage**: Converges well with proper settings
- **Diffusion stage**: Highly prone to overfitting, needs careful regularization
- **Consistency distillation**: Works well, minimal issues
- **Steady prior**: Often unnecessary for Burgers
