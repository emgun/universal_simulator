# WandB Logging Fixes - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-22
**Branch:** `feature/sota_burgers_upgrades`
**Status:** ✅ All fixes implemented and tested

---

## Overview

Fixed three critical bugs in the WandB logging implementation that were preventing proper metric visualization in the dashboard. The issues ranged from empty charts to missing stages to multiple runs being created per pipeline.

---

## Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Empty Training Charts
**Symptoms:**
- Training metric charts appeared in WandB dashboard
- Charts were completely empty (no data points)
- No error messages
- Metrics were being logged without errors

**User Report:** "Charts aren't populating with data"

### Problem 2: Multiple WandB Runs Created
**Symptoms:**
- Multiple runs appeared in WandB dashboard for single pipeline execution
- Separate runs for `small_eval`, `full_eval`, evaluation stages
- Confusion about which run contained which metrics
- Dashboard clutter

**User Report:** "Multiple runs are being created"

### Problem 3: Missing Stage Charts
**Symptoms:**
- Only operator stage charts appeared
- Diffusion, consistency, and steady_prior stages had no charts
- Training was in distill stage but charts didn't show it

**User Report:** "Only stage with charts is the operator (even though training is in distill stage)"

---

## Root Causes Discovered

### Bug #1: Step Metric Not Logged
**Root Cause:**
The step metric (e.g., `training/operator/step`) was defined via `wandb.define_metric()` but the step values were never actually logged to WandB. WandB requires the step metric to exist as data points to use it as an x-axis for charting.

**Code Location:** `src/ups/utils/wandb_context.py:45-73`

**What Was Wrong:**
```python
# BEFORE (broken)
def log_training_metric(self, stage: str, metric: str, value: float, step: int):
    key = f"training/{stage}/{metric}"
    self.run.log({key: value}, step=step)  # ❌ Step metric never logged!
```

**How It Failed:**
1. WandB defined that `training/operator/*` should use `training/operator/step` as x-axis
2. Training logged `training/operator/loss` with `step=100` parameter
3. But the `training/operator/step: 100` data point was never created
4. WandB couldn't find x-axis data → empty charts

### Bug #2: Legacy Run Creation Code
**Root Cause:**
Legacy function `_log_metrics_to_training_run()` in `scripts/run_fast_to_sota.py` was creating extra WandB runs via `wandb.init(resume="allow", reinit=True)` to log evaluation metrics. This was leftover code from the old architecture that should have been removed.

**Code Location:** `scripts/run_fast_to_sota.py:164-211, 922-924, 947, 1060, 1085`

**What Was Wrong:**
```python
# This function created NEW runs (called 4 times per pipeline!)
def _log_metrics_to_training_run(training_info, namespace, metrics):
    resumed = wandb.init(  # ❌ Creates NEW run
        id=run_id,
        resume="allow",
        reinit=True,  # ❌ Forces creation of new run
    )
    resumed.log(metrics)
    resumed.finish()
```

**Why It Was Still Running:**
- Documentation claimed this was removed
- But `wandb_ctx` was always `None` in orchestrator (line 636)
- Condition `if not wandb_ctx:` was always `True`
- Legacy code path ALWAYS executed

**The Flow (Incorrect):**
```
1. train.py creates ONE WandB run ✅
2. train.py saves context to file ✅
3. evaluate.py loads context, logs to same run ✅
4. run_fast_to_sota.py ALSO calls _log_metrics_to_training_run() ❌
5. Creates 4 NEW runs with wandb.init(reinit=True) ❌
```

### Bug #3: Stage Name Mismatch
**Root Cause:**
The metric patterns defined in `wandb_context.py` used shortened stage names that didn't match the actual stage names used in `train.py`.

**Code Location:** `src/ups/utils/wandb_context.py:346-360`

**What Was Wrong:**

| Component | Stage Names Used |
|-----------|------------------|
| `train.py` TrainingLogger (actual) | `operator`, `diffusion_residual`, `consistency_distill`, `steady_prior` |
| `wandb_context.py` define_metric (wrong) | `operator`, `diffusion`, `consistency`, `steady` ❌ |

**How It Failed:**
```python
# Metric logged by train.py:
"training/diffusion_residual/loss": 0.5

# Pattern defined in wandb_context.py:
wandb.define_metric("training/diffusion/*", step_metric="training/diffusion/step")

# Pattern doesn't match!
# "training/diffusion_residual/loss" != "training/diffusion/*"
# → No x-axis defined → No chart appears
```

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Log Step Metric Values ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**File:** `src/ups/utils/wandb_context.py:45-78`

**Change:**
```python
# AFTER (fixed)
def log_training_metric(self, stage: str, metric: str, value: float, step: int):
    key = f"training/{stage}/{metric}"
    step_key = f"training/{stage}/step"  # ← NEW

    # Log both the metric AND the step metric for proper charting
    # WandB needs the step metric to exist as data for define_metric() to work
    self.run.log({key: value, step_key: step}, step=step)  # ← FIXED
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested (2025-01-22)

**Impact:**
- Step metric now logged as data point
- WandB can use it as x-axis
- All charts now display properly

### Fix #2: Remove Legacy Run Creation
**File:** `scripts/run_fast_to_sota.py:164-211`

**Change:**
```python
# DELETED entire function (48 lines)
# def _log_metrics_to_training_run(...):
#     ...

# Replaced with comment:
# Legacy function removed - evaluation subprocess logs metrics directly to training run
# via WANDB_CONTEXT_FILE mechanism (see WandBContext in src/ups/utils/wandb_context.py)
```

**Removed all 4 call sites:**
- Line 922-924: small_eval metrics logging
- Line 947: small_eval gate results
- Line 1060: full_eval metrics logging
- Line 1085: full_eval gate results

**Why This Is Safe:**
- Evaluation already logs via `WANDB_CONTEXT_FILE` mechanism
- `evaluate.py` loads context and logs to same run
- No functionality lost - metrics still appear in single training run

**Impact:**
- Only ONE WandB run per pipeline
- All metrics (training + evaluation) in single run
- No duplicate/extra runs

### Fix #3: Correct Stage Names in Metric Definitions ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**File:** `src/ups/utils/wandb_context.py:346-360`

**Change:**
```python
# BEFORE (broken - wrong stage names)
wandb.define_metric("training/diffusion/*", step_metric="training/diffusion/step")
wandb.define_metric("training/consistency/*", step_metric="training/consistency/step")
wandb.define_metric("training/steady/*", step_metric="training/steady/step")

# AFTER (fixed - correct stage names)
wandb.define_metric("training/operator/step")  # ← NEW: define step metrics first
wandb.define_metric("training/diffusion_residual/step")
wandb.define_metric("training/consistency_distill/step")
wandb.define_metric("training/steady_prior/step")

wandb.define_metric("training/operator/*", step_metric="training/operator/step")
wandb.define_metric("training/diffusion_residual/*", step_metric="training/diffusion_residual/step")  # ← FIXED
wandb.define_metric("training/consistency_distill/*", step_metric="training/consistency_distill/step")  # ← FIXED
wandb.define_metric("training/steady_prior/*", step_metric="training/steady_prior/step")  # ← FIXED
```

**Impact:**
- All training stages now have charts
- Metrics from all stages display correctly
- Each stage has its own step metric for proper x-axis

---

## Architecture - Before vs After

### Before (Broken)

**WandB Runs:**
```
Pipeline Execution
├─ Training Run (train.py) ✅
├─ Small Eval Run (_log_metrics_to_training_run) ❌
├─ Full Eval Run (_log_metrics_to_training_run) ❌
└─ Gate Results Runs (2x _log_metrics_to_training_run) ❌

Total: 5 runs per pipeline ❌
```

**Charts:**
```
training/operator/loss ✅ (but empty - no step data)
training/operator/lr ✅ (but empty - no step data)
training/diffusion_residual/loss ❌ (pattern mismatch - no chart)

## Key Learnings

### 1. WandB Step Metrics Must Be Logged As Data
**Lesson:** `wandb.define_metric()` tells WandB what to use as x-axis, but you still need to log the step metric values.

**Wrong Assumption:**
```python
wandb.define_metric("training/operator/*", step_metric="training/operator/step")
# Assumption: WandB will automatically use the `step` parameter as x-axis
```

**Correct Understanding:**
```python
wandb.define_metric("training/operator/*", step_metric="training/operator/step")
# WandB will look for a metric named "training/operator/step" in the logged data
# You MUST log it: wandb.log({"training/operator/step": 100})
```

### 2. Pattern Matching Must Be Exact
**Lesson:** WandB's wildcard patterns are exact string matches - `training/diffusion/*` does NOT match `training/diffusion_residual/loss`.

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't use shortened names in patterns
- Must match exactly what's logged
- Underscores matter!

### 3. Legacy Code Is Dangerous
**Lesson:** Comments saying code is "no longer needed" aren't enough - the code must actually be removed.

**What Happened:**
- Documentation said: "Removed orchestrator WandB run"
- Comments said: "no longer needed with clean WandB context"
- But condition was `if not wandb_ctx:` where `wandb_ctx` was always `None`
- Result: Legacy code always executed

**Fix:** Delete the code, don't just comment it out or gate it with a flag.

### 4. Verify Assumptions With Real Data
**Lesson:** The architecture documentation said the single-run design was implemented, but actual behavior showed multiple runs.

**Debugging Approach:**
1. User reported symptom: "Multiple runs created"
2. Searched for all `wandb.init()` calls
3. Found legacy function still being called
4. Traced through why condition was always true
5. Removed legacy code entirely

---

## Expected Behavior Going Forward

### Single Run Per Pipeline
Every pipeline execution (training + eval) creates exactly **one WandB run**:

```
Run ID: train-20251023_XXXXXX
├─ Config Tab
│  ├─ latent_dim: 32
│  ├─ operator_epochs: 25
│  └─ ...
├─ Charts Tab
│  ├─ training/operator/loss (line chart, 25 points)
│  ├─ training/operator/lr (line chart, 25 points)
│  ├─ training/diffusion_residual/loss (line chart, 8 points)
│  ├─ training/consistency_distill/loss (line chart, 8 points)
│  └─ ...
└─ Summary Tab
   ├─ eval/nrmse: 0.09
   ├─ eval/mse: 0.001
   └─ eval/physics/*
```

### All Stages Visible
Every training stage gets its own charts:
- ✅ `training/operator/*` - Operator training (25 epochs)
- ✅ `training/diffusion_residual/*` - Diffusion training (8 epochs)
- ✅ `training/consistency_distill/*` - Consistency distillation (8 epochs)
- ✅ `training/steady_prior/*` - Steady prior (if enabled)

### Charts Populated With Data
Every chart shows actual data points with proper x-axis:
- ✅ Loss curves decrease over training
- ✅ Learning rate schedules visible
- ✅ Gradient norms tracked
- ✅ X-axis shows step numbers (not empty)

### Clean Dashboard
No extra runs cluttering the dashboard:
- ❌ No separate "small_eval" runs
- ❌ No separate "full_eval" runs
- ❌ No duplicate training runs
- ✅ One comprehensive run per pipeline
